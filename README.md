# DeepQC
DeepLearning-based lossless compression tool for quality values of sequencing data.

Source code and excutable binary file can be found in <font color=#0099ff  face="黑体">c++</font> folder.

We provide some pre-trained models of several most popular platforms. If other platform is involved, users could train the model themselves. 

Training code can be found in <font color=#0099ff  face="黑体">python</font> folder. The author would be pleased if someone upload their well-trained models of diversity platforms.

In our observation, DeepQC still has huge potentiality in running speed. We do plan to release a faster verison in future using multi-threading technology.
