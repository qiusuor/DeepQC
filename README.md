# DeepQC
DeepLearning-based lossless compression tool for quality values of sequencing data.

Source code and excutable binary file can be found in `c++` folder.

We provide some pre-trained models of several most popular platforms. If other platform is involved, users could train the model themselves. 

Training code can be found in `python` folder. The author would be pleased if someone upload their well-trained models of diversity platforms.

# Quick start

We provide an simple example in folder `example`.
