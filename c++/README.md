#  Requirement:

 *   Libtorch-1.2.0


We provide a compiled excutable binary file. IF it doesn't work, re-compile in following steps:


*   Edit Torch_DIR in CMakeLists.txt accordingly
*   rm CMakeCache.txt
*   mkdir build && cd build
*   cmake ..
*   make
*   cp DeepQC ../

You may need to delete CMakeCache.txt when re-compile. Just ignore cmake warnings if appear.
